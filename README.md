<h1 align = "left">Hi! I am Valeria :wave:</h1>

<h2> About me:</h2>

I am a self-proclaimed nerd, who enjoys learning about a wide range of topics, but with a prevalent interest in the intersection of psychology and technology. I do mixed-methods research on a variety of topics, but mostly around behavioral science, consumer behavior and consumer-experiences. 
You can find some of my projects with the stats and code below. :blush:
